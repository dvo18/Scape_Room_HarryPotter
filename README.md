The Harry Potter-themed escape room game takes you on an exciting adventure in the magical world. You find yourself in a dark and mysterious place that appears to be a potions classroom at Hogwarts (the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry). The room is decorated with elements from the Harry Potter universe, such as portraits of the Hogwarts houses, potions, a large cauldron, and other magical objects.

The goal of the game is to complete a series of challenges that will lead you through the room, which you must overcome to find the exit.
